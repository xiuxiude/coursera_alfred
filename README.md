Ackownledgement

* Here are three main folders in `./coursera_alfred/src`.There are `bg`, `browser_action` and `inject`.
* `bg` stands for background page, which is always running at backgroud. we use it to fetch data from coursera, parse data and then store parsed data at localstorage.
* `browser_action` is made for courses'schedule feature, it only has the ablity to fetch data from localstorage since we stored data which we want at localstorage.
* The `inject` subfolder is for 'multi-download' feture.
