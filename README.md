##To Developer

* Coursera alfred is developed with [angluarJS](http://angularjs.org/), so you need to understand some thing about it for better developing.

* Also you are supposed to have some knowledge of [chrome extension api](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/).

* We use Kris Kowal's [Promise](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) implementation [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) to deal with async code.


Setup

* install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) first
* we use [bower](http://bower.io/) as our client-side package manager, run `npm install -g bower` to install bower
* `bower install` to install all the dependencies

Ackownledgement

* Here are three main folders in `./src`.There are `bg`, `browser_action` and `inject`.

* `bg` stands for background page, which is always running at backgroud. We use it to fetch data from coursera, parse data and then store parsed data at localStorage.

* `browser_action` is the popup window when you click the extension icon, which fetch the data from localStorage .

* The `inject` is for all the content-script running in the context of Coursera's own page. Currently, there is only the multi-download button inject in the Coursera course page.
